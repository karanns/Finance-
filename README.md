Finance Concepts in Python


1. Value at Risk 

Value at risk is a key risk management metric used since the last two decades. 
How does it work ? - Let's assume we have a probability distribution which is normally distributed.(i.e. mean = 0, std = 1)
Let's assume that our distribution has a 95% confidence interval. Since VAR is a quantile study, let's assume that at the 95% interval we have an amount of $120.
This states that there is a 5% chance that the VAR will be greater than $120 for a given period. 

Disadvantage of the VaR Concept

Let's assume we have an outlier and the outlier falls outside the confidence interval chosen. In this case the VAR cannot factor-in this loss and it always shows the losses which occus in the confidence interval chosen/ the probability of the loss that is relevant.
