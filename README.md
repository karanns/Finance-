1. Value at Risk 

Value at risk is a key risk management metric used since the last two decades. 
How does it work ? - Let's assume we have a probability distribution which is normally distributed.(i.e. mean = 0, std = 1)
Let's assume that our distribution has a 95% confidence interval. Since VAR is a quantile study, let's assume that the at the 95% interval we have an amount of $120.
This states that there is a 5% chance that the VAR will be greater than $120 for a given period.
